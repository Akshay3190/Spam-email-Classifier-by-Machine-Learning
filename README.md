# Spam-email-Classifier-by-Machine-Learning
<br>
Classified the data of 5k+ mails.
<br>
<br>
Developed a model by using 'LinearRegression' to classify the mail into 2 categories.
<br>
'ham mail' & 'spam mail'
<br>
<br>
Ham-Mail-
<br>
"Ham" is an e-mail that is other than Spam. In other words, "non-spam", or "good mail". It should be considered a shorter, snappier synonym for "non-spam". Its usage is particularly common among anti-spam software developers, and not widely known elsewhere; in general, it is probably better to use the term "non-spam", instead.

What is Vectorizer?
<br>
Vectorization is the process of converting words into numbers is called Vectorization, It is a methodology in NLP to map words or phrases from vocabulary to a corresponding vector of real numbers which is used to find word predictions, similarities, etc.
<br>
<br>
Train & Test splitting-
<br>
Split the model into train & test. We have to train the model first for the classification of emails & then we will have to test the model for implementation so that we can categorize the emails accordingly.
<br>
<br>
Accuracy Score-
<br>
To check the accuracy of the model we used the 'accuracy score' function.
