# Spam-email-Classifier-by-Machine-Learning
<br>
Classified the data of 5k+ mails.
<br>
<br>
Developed a model by using 'LinearRegression' to classify the mail into 2 categories.
<br>
<br>
Logistic Regression-
<br>
<br>
It’s a popular classification algorithm used in ML. It's part of  the Sikit learn library  in Python. Regression is suitable for binary classification problems where the target variable has 2 classes. Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.
<br>
<br>
In this case, 2 categories of emails are as follows-
<br>
<br>
'ham mail' & 'spam mail'
<br>
<br>
Ham-Mail-
<br>
"Ham" is an e-mail that is other than Spam. In other words, "non-spam", or "good mail". It should be considered a shorter, snappier synonym for "non-spam". Its usage is particularly common among anti-spam software developers, and not widely known elsewhere; in general, it is probably better to use the term "non-spam", instead.

What is Vectorizer?
<br>
Vectorization is the process of converting words into numbers is called Vectorization, It is a methodology in NLP to map words or phrases from vocabulary to a corresponding vector of real numbers which is used to find word predictions, similarities, etc.
<br>
<br>
TFID vectorizer-
<br>
TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a handy algorithm that uses the frequency of words to determine how relevant those words are to a given document.
<br>
It is a feature of the extraction technique, commonly used in NLP & text-mining tasks. It is a part Sikit library which  transform a collection of text document into numeric representation so that ML algorithm can work.
<br>
<br>
Train & Test splitting-
<br>
Split the model into train & test. We have to train the model first for the classification of emails & then we will have to test the model for implementation so that we can categorize the emails accordingly.
<br>
<br>
Accuracy Score-
<br>
To check the accuracy of the model we used the 'accuracy score' function.
<br>
It’s a function that is a performance metric provide by sikit learn library  in Python. It is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by measuring the accuracy of its prediction.
